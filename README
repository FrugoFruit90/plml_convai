# THE CODE WILL APPEAR ON THE DAY OF THE WORKSHOP

# Tutorial on Conversational AI
Teaching machines to accomplish tasks by conversing naturally with humans is challenging. Currently,
developing task-oriented dialogue systems requires creating multiple components and typically this involves
either a large amount of handcrafting, or acquiring costly labelled datasets to solve a statistical learning
problem for each component. In this tutorial we will give an introduction to task oriented dialogues systems
within a classical modular approach as well as recent approaches to unifying a system into one structure. The
workshop is going to be divided into theoretical and practical parts. We will go through major components of
dialogue systems from theoretical and practical point. Natural language understanding, policy management and
natural language generation will be discussed and analyzed based on the state-of-the-art approaches. At the
end of this tutorial you will be able to build a basic generative model in an end-to-end way using data collected
in a Wizard-of-Oz fashion.

# Requirements
Create virtual environment:
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 my_project
```
source it
```
source my_project/bin/activate
```
and install necessary requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
(you may need running `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python`)
 
 These are the only requirements to run the code - the dataset is very lightweight
 so all experiments you can easily run on the your private machine.
